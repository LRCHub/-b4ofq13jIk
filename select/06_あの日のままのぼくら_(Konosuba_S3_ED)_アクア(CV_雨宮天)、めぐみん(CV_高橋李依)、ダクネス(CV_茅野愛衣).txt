Rather than say you whom
I haven't met in a while is still the same
It appears to me that
You haven't changed a bit

Though I at least know
That couldn't possibly be true
The time we spent apart
Feels like it never happened

Formal things like promises
Are unnecessary between us

The hopeless us who
Just fooled around
Us like we were that day
Who returned after a long time

Come to think of it
We used to talk endlessly
But what were we talking about?
I don't remember anything

Complicated things like growing up
Are not written in our dictionary

We had deceived, we had lied
We had inconvenienced each other
But though I'll never say it out loud
I love even those things
